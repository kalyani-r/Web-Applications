<h1 class = "heading"> <center> COMPUTER SCIENCE DEPARTMENT </center> </h1>
<p> The department offers a wide range of masters programs: <em>Computer Science, Information Systems, Information Security and Assurance, and Software Engineering.</em> 
</p>
<p> Graduate classes are offered in the late afternoon and evening to accommodate the professionally employed students.
    Financial aid in the form of graduate assistantships may be available for full- time degree-seeking students. 
    Appropriate courses may be transferred, with advisor approval, into the degree program.
</p>
<h1 class = "special">Masters of Science in Computer Science</h1>
<p>The Master of Science in Computer Science offers students the opportunity to combine a sound foundation in computer science 
   with concentrated knowledge in the latest developments in particular areas. Our faculty have expertise in many areas of computer science, 
   including algorithms and theory, artificial intelligence and computer vision, systems and networks, databases and data mining, graphics and image 
   processing, security, programming languages, and software engineering. 
</p>

<h1 class = "special">Masters of Science in Information Security and Assurance</h1>
<p>This program satisfies the dual needs of preparing graduates to fill the need for information security and assurance professionals to work in a 
   wide variety of capacities to protect the information systems of different types of organizations, and to support the nation's information 
   infrastructure and conducting advanced research and in information security and assurance. Consequently, the degree provides technical knowledge 
   and skills to understand information security, and provides specialized theoretical knowledge and experimental experience.   
</p>

<h1 class = "special">Masters of Science in Information Systems</h1>
<p>This professional degree program focuses on the technical, managerial and policy issues associated with designing, building and maintaining 
   information systems in organizations. Data, information and knowledge are crucial to the modern enterprise, and the MS in Information Systems (MSIS) 
   program addresses both the theoretical and engineering aspects of specifying, designing, implementing and managing large-scale information systems. 
</p>

<h1 class = "special">Masters of Science in Software Engineering</h1>
<p>The Master of Science in Software Engineering provides specialized knowledge and experience in developing and modifying large, complex software
   systems. It emphasizes technical and management aspects of the software engineering process. Software engineering is an established discipline based
   on requirement analysis, design, construction, testing, maintenance, economics, and management issues of software engineering. A pragmatic approach 
   to problem solving is the hallmark of a software engineer. Software engineers are concerned with the theoretical and practical aspects of technology,
   cost, and social impact of software systems that are both effective and efficient.
